      </p>

      <h2>1. Choose the Right RV for Your Trip</h2>
      <p>
        Before planning your route, you need to decide on your RV. Consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Class A Motorhomes:</strong> Largest and most luxurious, best for long trips</li>
        <li><strong>Class B Campervans:</strong> Compact and fuel-efficient, perfect for couples</li>
        <li><strong>Class C Motorhomes:</strong> Mid-size with overhead sleeping, great for families</li>
        <li><strong>Travel Trailers:</strong> Towable options that offer flexibility</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Plan Your Route Strategically</h2>
      <p>
        Route planning is crucial for RV travel. Unlike car trips, you need to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Height restrictions and low bridges</li>
        <li>Road weight limits</li>
        <li>Steep grades and mountain passes</li>
        <li>RV-friendly gas stations</li>
        <li>Campground availability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Essential Route Planning Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Start with major destinations:</strong> Pick 3-5 must-see stops
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calculate realistic driving times:</strong> Plan for 200-300 miles per day maximum
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Book campgrounds in advance:</strong> Especially during peak season
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build in flexibility:</strong> Allow extra days for weather or discoveries
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>3. Budget for Your RV Trip</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding RV trip costs helps avoid surprises. Your main expenses will include:
      </p>

      <table className="w-full border-collapse my-6">
        <thead>
          <tr className="bg-gray-100">
            <th className="border p-3 text-left">Expense Category</th>
            <th className="border p-3 text-left">Average Daily Cost</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td className="border p-3">Fuel</td>
            <td className="border p-3">$50-150</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td className="border p-3">Campground Fees</td>
            <td className="border p-3">$30-75</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td className="border p-3">Food & Groceries</td>
            <td className="border p-3">$40-80</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td className="border p-3">Activities & Attractions</td>
            <td className="border p-3">$20-100</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td className="border p-3">Maintenance & Supplies</td>
            <td className="border p-3">$10-30</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Ensure sites accommodate your RV length</li>
