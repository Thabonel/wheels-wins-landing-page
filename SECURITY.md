- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented for XSS protection
- **Secure Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive form validation
- **Security Overrides**: Package.json overrides for known vulnerabilities

### Backend Security
- **API Security**: FastAPI with comprehensive input validation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- **Rate Limiting**: API abuse prevention
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict origin control
- **Data Encryption**: In-transit and at-rest encryption
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security header implementation

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) with Supabase
- **Network Security**: Firewall and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring with Sentry

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Checks
```bash
# Frontend security audit
npm run security:audit

# Full security check
npm run security:check:full

# Fix frontend vulnerabilities
npm run security:fix
```

### Backend Security Scanning
```bash
# Python dependency security scan
cd backend
safety scan --file requirements-core.txt

# Static security analysis
bandit -r app/

# Comprehensive dependency audit
pip-audit -r requirements-core.txt
```

## üìã Known Security Considerations

### Current Vulnerabilities (As of January 2025)

1. **lodash.template (HIGH)**: Command injection vulnerability
   - **Status**: No fix available from upstream
   - **Mitigation**: Security override in package.json
   - **Impact**: Development dependencies only, not runtime

2. **esbuild (MODERATE)**: Development server vulnerability  
   - **Status**: Fixed in version 0.25.8+
   - **Mitigation**: Version override in package.json
   - **Impact**: Development environment only

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Package Overrides**: Force secure versions where available
2. **Dependency Isolation**: Separate dev/prod dependencies
3. **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring
4. **Regular Updates**: Monthly security update cycles

## üîÑ Security Update Process

### Regular Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Automated vulnerability scanning via GitHub Actions
- **Monthly**: Manual security review and dependency updates
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit
- **As-needed**: Emergency security patches

### Update Workflow
1. Security vulnerability identified
2. Impact assessment performed
3. Fix developed and tested
4. Staged deployment for validation
5. Production deployment
6. Post-deployment monitoring

## üéØ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Always run security audits before commits
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement input validation for all user inputs
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regular dependency updates

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Keep browsers updated
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Review app permissions regularly

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Sentry**: Error and security event tracking
- **GitHub Security**: Dependabot alerts and security advisories
- **Supabase**: Database security monitoring
- **Custom Alerts**: Application-specific security monitoring

### Security Metrics
- Vulnerability detection time
- Mean time to remediation
- Security test coverage
- Dependency freshness index

## üîß Emergency Response

### Security Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Immediate impact evaluation
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove security threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvement

### Contact Information
- **Security Team**: security@wheelsandwins.com
- **Emergency Contact**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (24/7)
