## ‚úÖ PostCSS Configuration Fixed!

### Issue Resolved:
The PostCSS/autoprefixer module loading error that was preventing tests from running has been successfully fixed.

### Solution Applied:
1. **Cleaned and reinstalled node_modules** - Removed and reinstalled all dependencies
2. **Created new PostCSS config** - Changed from `postcss.config.js` to `postcss.config.mjs` with proper ES module syntax
3. **Verified dev server** - Server now starts without errors on port 8080
4. **Confirmed with tests** - Playwright tests now run successfully

### New PostCSS Configuration (`postcss.config.mjs`):
```javascript
import tailwindcss from 'tailwindcss';
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';

export default {
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss,
    autoprefixer,
  ],
};
```
