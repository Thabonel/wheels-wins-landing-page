# Wheels & Wins - Claude Code Prompt Library

## üéØ Purpose
This document contains battle-tested prompts for common development tasks in the Wheels & Wins project. Copy and adapt these for maximum efficiency with Claude Code.

---

## üîç Context Building Prompts

### Initial Project Exploration
```
Prepare to discuss how the Wheels & Wins platform works. Read cloud.md, CLAUDE.md, and all subfolder cloud.md files. 
Analyze:
1. Frontend architecture (React, TypeScript, component structure)
2. Backend services (FastAPI, TTS, WebSocket)
3. Database design (Supabase, RLS policies)
4. External integrations (Mapbox, OpenAI)
5. Current issues in CHANGELOG.md
Do not write code. Summarize patterns and potential improvements.
```

### Feature-Specific Deep Dive
```
Explore the [PAM AI assistant/Trip Planning/Financial Management] system in detail.
Read all files in:
- src/components/[pam|wheels|wins]/
- src/services/[pam|trips|expenses].ts
- src/hooks/use[Pam|Trips|Expenses].ts
- backend/app/services/[relevant].py
Identify the data flow, state management approach, and integration points.
```

## üìã Planning Prompts

### New Feature Planning
```
Think hard. Create a plan to add [offline trip syncing] to Wheels & Wins.
Requirements:
- Work offline using service workers
- Sync when connection restored
- Handle conflicts gracefully
- Show sync status in UI

Break into 3 PRs (max 500 lines each):
1. Service worker setup and caching
2. Offline data management 
3. UI sync indicators

For each PR, specify:
- Key functions (1-2 sentences each)
- Test scenarios (5-10 words each)
- Dependencies to add
```

### Performance Optimization Planning
```
Analyze performance bottlenecks in [trip planning/expense calculations].
Current issues:
- [Slow map loads on mobile]
- [Bundle size too large]

Create optimization plan:
1. Quick wins (< 1 hour each)
2. Medium improvements (< 1 day each)
3. Major refactors (specify effort)

Include metrics to measure success.
```

### Bug Fix Planning
```
Debug the issue: "[PAM voice responses cutting off mid-sentence]"
1. Read error logs and related code
2. Identify root cause possibilities
3. Create minimal fix plan
4. List regression test scenarios
5. Suggest long-term improvements

Prefer surgical fixes over rewrites.
```

## üî® Execution Prompts

### Component Development
```
Implement PR #1: Create OfflineSyncIndicator component.
Requirements:
- Show sync status (synced/syncing/error/offline)
- Use existing UI components from src/components/ui/
- Follow our TypeScript patterns
- Mobile-first design with Tailwind
- Add to relevant pages (TripPlanner, ExpenseTracker)

Write clean code with no comments. Run quality checks.
```

### API Endpoint Creation
```
Add new endpoint: POST /api/v1/trips/{trip_id}/share
- FastAPI route in backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/trips.py
- Pydantic schemas for request/response
- Service layer logic in backend/app/services/trip.py
- Proper auth with dependency injection
- Return shareable link with expiration

Follow existing patterns. Add OpenAPI documentation.
```

### Database Migration
```
Using Supabase MCP, create migration for user preferences:
1. Analyze existing user tables and RLS policies
2. Create preferences table with:
   - theme (light/dark/auto)
   - notification settings (email/push/sms)
   - privacy settings (profile visibility)
3. Add RLS policies (users can only edit own)
4. Create TypeScript types
5. Test migration up and down

Generate SQL in supabase/migrations/ format.
```

### Test Writing
```
Write comprehensive tests for ExpenseTracker component:
1. Unit tests with React Testing Library
2. Mock useExpenses hook
3. Test scenarios:
   - Initial load state
   - Add/edit/delete expense
   - Category filtering
   - Date range selection
   - Error states
   - Mobile responsiveness
4. Achieve 90%+ coverage
Use existing test patterns from __tests__/
```

## üîÑ Refactoring Prompts

### Code Modernization
```
Refactor [TripPlanner component] to use modern React patterns:
- Convert class components to functional
- Replace Redux with Tanstack Query
- Use React.lazy for code splitting
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading skeletons
Maintain exact functionality. Update tests.
```

### Performance Refactor
```
Optimize [map rendering] performance:
1. Profile current implementation
2. Implement:
   - Viewport-based marker clustering
   - Lazy load map overlays
   - Debounce user interactions
   - Memory cleanup on unmount
3. Measure improvements
4. Document optimizations in cloud.md
```

## üêõ Debugging Prompts

### Complex Bug Investigation
```
Investigate: "WebSocket connection drops after 5 minutes on mobile"
1. Check backend/app/api/v1/pam.py WebSocket handler
2. Review connection lifecycle and heartbeat
3. Check mobile browser limitations
4. Analyze server logs from last 24h
5. Test on multiple devices
6. Propose fixes with minimal changes
Include root cause analysis.
```

### Memory Leak Hunt
```
Find memory leaks in trip planning feature:
1. Use Chrome DevTools heap snapshots
2. Check for:
   - Unremoved event listeners
   - Retained Mapbox instances
   - Circular references
   - Uncleared intervals/timeouts
3. Fix leaks with minimal refactoring
4. Add cleanup to useEffect returns
```
