# FINAL PHOTO CONNECTION

## ðŸŽ¯ One Simple Step:

**Run `FINAL_CORRECT_CONNECTIONS.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor**

This will:
1. âœ… Clear ALL existing photos (clean slate)
2. âœ… Connect photos to the exact 15 Australian templates you showed me
3. âœ… Show you the results

## ðŸ“¸ What Will Get Photos:
- Great Ocean Road Classic â†’ Twelve Apostles
- The Big Lap - Around Australia â†’ Uluru
- East Coast Discovery â†’ Great Barrier Reef + Byron Bay
- Red Centre Explorer â†’ Uluru
- Tasmania Circuit â†’ Cradle Mountain + Wineglass Bay
- Southwest WA Wine & Surf â†’ Margaret River
- Flinders Ranges Expedition â†’ Wilpena Pound

## ðŸ“Š Expected Result:
- **7 templates** will have correct Australian photos
- **8 templates** will still need photos (we only have 8 photos total)

**This should finally fix the photo connections!**
