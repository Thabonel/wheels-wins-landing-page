## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### If PAM won't stop talking:
```javascript
// Emergency kill switch - add to console
window.stopPAM = true;
localStorage.setItem('pam_disabled', 'true');
```

### If site navigation breaks:
```bash
# Reset React Router
npm run dev -- --force
```

### If GPT-5 API fails:
```bash
# Revert to GPT-4 in backend
cd backend
# Edit app/core/config.py
# Change: MODEL = "gpt-5" 
# To: MODEL = "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
```

### If visual control causes infinite loops:
```javascript
// Add to App.tsx
window.PAM_VISUAL_CONTROL = false;
```

---

## üîß PARTIAL ROLLBACK

If only specific features need reverting:

### Disable Visual Control Only:
```typescript
// In src/components/Pam.tsx
const ENABLE_VISUAL_CONTROL = false; // Add at top
```

### Disable GPT-5 Only:
```python
# In backend/app/api/v1/pam.py
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4-turbo-preview"  # Revert from gpt-5
```

### Disable Voice Features:
```typescript
// In src/components/Pam.tsx
const VOICE_ENABLED = false; // Override all voice
```
