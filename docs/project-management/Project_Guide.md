# Project Guide

This document provides a high level overview of the Wheels and Wins project and explains how to keep the documentation up to date.

## Documentation Workflow

- All project documentation lives in the `docs/` directory.
- Individual topics are organized into subfolders such as `features`, `guides`, and `technical`.
- When adding new articles, follow the formatting style used in the existing files.
- Use descriptive headings, bullet lists, and code blocks where appropriate.

## Keeping This Guide Updated

This file is intended to be a living resource. Place it in the `docs/` folder so it can be edited as the project evolves. Submit a pull request any time you add or modify sections so the team can review your updates.

## Additional Resources

See `README.md` at the project root for details on setting up the environment and running the application.
