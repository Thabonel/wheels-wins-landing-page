# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural and technical decisions made during the development of Wheels & Wins.

## üìã ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-pam-websocket-architecture.md) | PAM WebSocket Architecture Redesign | Proposed | 2025-01-31 |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-frontend-state-management.md) | Frontend State Management Strategy | Proposed | TBD |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-database-performance-optimization.md) | Database Performance Optimization | Proposed | TBD |

## üîÑ ADR Process

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Copy the template**: `cp ADR-TEMPLATE.md ADR-XXX-your-decision-title.md`
2. **Assign the next number**: Check the index above for the next available number
3. **Fill out all sections**: Don't skip sections - mark as "N/A" if not applicable
4. **Review with team**: Get feedback before marking as "Accepted"
5. **Update the index**: Add your ADR to the table above

### ADR Statuses

- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision made and approved for implementation
- **Rejected**: Considered but decided against
- **Deprecated**: Previously accepted but no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to the newer ADR)

## üéØ When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making decisions about:

### Architecture & Design
- Technology stack choices (frameworks, libraries, databases)
- System architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, etc.)
- API design approaches (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Authentication and authorization strategies

### Technical Implementation
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security implementation approaches
- Testing strategies and frameworks
- Deployment and infrastructure decisions

### Process & Standards
- Code organization and structure
- Development workflow changes
- Quality standards and gates
- Monitoring and observability approaches

## üìö ADR Best Practices

### Writing Guidelines
- **Be concise but complete**: Include all necessary context and rationale
- **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Include alternatives**: Show what options were considered and why they were rejected
- **Quantify when possible**: Use metrics, benchmarks, and specific criteria
- **Reference source materials**: Link to requirements, research, and related decisions

### Technical Details
- **Code examples**: Include snippets to illustrate implementation approaches
- **Diagrams**: Use architecture diagrams when helpful
- **Migration paths**: Document how to transition from current to new approach
- **Testing approach**: Specify how the decision will be validated

### Maintenance
- **Update status**: Keep the status field current as decisions evolve
- **Link related ADRs**: Maintain connections between related decisions
- **Review regularly**: Periodically review ADRs to ensure they're still relevant

## üîó Integration with Development Workflow

ADRs are integrated into our standard development workflow:

1. **Plan the Architecture** ‚Üí Create ADR for significant decisions
2. **Define Types and Tests** ‚Üí Document testing approach in ADR
3. **Build with Parallel Agents** ‚Üí Reference ADR for coordination
4. **Review Tests and Key Decisions** ‚Üí Update ADR with outcomes
5. **Document Everything** ‚Üí ADR serves as permanent record
6. **Repeat with Context Preserved** ‚Üí ADRs maintain institutional knowledge
