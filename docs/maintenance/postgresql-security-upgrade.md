# PostgreSQL Security Upgrade Requirements

## Current Status
- **Database Provider**: Supabase (Managed PostgreSQL)
- **Current Version**: PostgreSQL 15.x
- **Security Status**: Security patches available
- **Impact**: Low to Medium risk

## Identified Issues
1. **Security Patches Available**: Current PostgreSQL version has known security vulnerabilities with available patches
2. **Upgrade Path**: Managed through Supabase dashboard/support

## Upgrade Strategy

### Option 1: Automatic Minor Version Upgrade (Recommended)
- **When**: Next maintenance window
- **Method**: Supabase dashboard settings
- **Downtime**: Minimal (typically 1-2 minutes)
- **Risk**: Very low

### Option 2: Major Version Upgrade

- **Method**: Supabase support assistance
- **Downtime**: Planned maintenance window
- **Risk**: Low (managed service)

## Implementation Steps

### Immediate Action (Low Priority)
1. **Check Current Version**:
   ```sql
   SELECT version();
   ```

2. **Review Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to Project Settings > General
   - Check for available updates under Database section
   - Review maintenance notifications

### Planned Upgrade (Next Maintenance Window)
1. **Pre-upgrade Checklist**:
   - [ ] Create database backup (automatic with Supabase)

   - [ ] Verify database connectivity
   - [ ] Run smoke tests on key features
   - [ ] Check application logs for any issues
   - [ ] Confirm all migrations still work

## Security Benefits
- **CVE Patching**: Addresses known security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Minor improvements in query optimization
