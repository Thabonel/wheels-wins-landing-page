### 3. Storage Status Verification

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear Visual Feedback**
   - Button shows "Choose Photo" initially
   - Changes to "Uploading..." with spinner during upload
   - Shows "Uploaded!" with checkmark on success
   - Displays filename when selected

2. **Better Error Messages**
   - File too large → "File too large. Maximum size is 10MB."
   - Wrong file type → "Invalid file type. Please upload JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP."
   - Storage issues → Direct link to Supabase Dashboard

3. **Professional UI**
   - Circular avatar preview
   - Smooth animations
   - Responsive design
   - Accessibility-friendly

## Testing the Upload
1. Go to your Profile page
2. Click "Choose Photo" button
3. Select an image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP under 10MB)
4. Watch the upload progress
5. See success message and updated avatar

## If Upload Still Fails
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to check RLS policies:
```sql
-- Check if you have the right policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' 
AND tablename = 'objects'
AND policyname LIKE '%profile%';
```

If no policies exist, run the migration file:
`supabase/migrations/20250125_verify_storage_setup.sql`

## Files Modified
- `src/components/profile/ProfileImageUpload.tsx` - Complete UI overhaul
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and validation
- `supabase/migrations/20250125_verify_storage_setup.sql` - Storage verification

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// New upload flow with feedback
1. User clicks styled button → file picker opens
2. File selected → validation checks
3. Upload starts → loading animation
4. Progress shown → user sees activity
5. Success/Error → clear message
6. Avatar updates → instant feedback
```

## Result
The profile photo upload now has:
- Professional UI with clear feedback
- Robust error handling
- Storage validation
- Automatic recovery attempts
- User-friendly messages

The feature is now production-ready with a great user experience!
