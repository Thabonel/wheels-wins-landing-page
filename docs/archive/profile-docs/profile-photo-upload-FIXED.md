# Profile Photo Upload - FIXED ✅

## Date: January 25, 2025

## Issue Resolution
The profile photo upload is now **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**! 

### What Was Wrong
- The `storage.objects` table had no default value for `owner_id`
- This caused SQL parameter placeholders (`$1`, `$2`) to be inserted as literal values
- The storage bucket policies were too restrictive

### What Was Fixed
1. **SQL Fix Applied** ✅
   - Set `owner_id` default to empty string
   - Made `owner` column nullable
   - Recreated bucket with proper settings
   - Updated RLS policies for authenticated users

2. **Code Improvements** ✅
   - Enhanced UI with loading states and feedback
   - Added file validation (size and type)
   - Better error messages
   - Simplified upload logic

### Current Status
- **Storage Schema**: ✅ Exists
- **Objects Table**: ✅ Exists
- **Buckets Table**: ✅ Exists
- **Profile-Images Bucket**: ✅ Created
- **RLS Policies**: ✅ Configured
- **Owner ID Default**: ✅ Fixed (`''::text`)
