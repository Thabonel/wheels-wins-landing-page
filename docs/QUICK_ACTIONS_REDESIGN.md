## Overview
The Quick Actions system has been completely redesigned to provide a modern, mobile-first user experience for adding expenses, fuel logs, receipts, and other travel-related data.

## Design Patterns

### Mobile-First Approach

- Swipe gestures support
- iOS keyboard handling

### Desktop Experience

- Grid layout for action selection
- Hover effects and keyboard navigation
- Optimized for mouse interaction

## Styling

### QuickActionStyles.css

// Add FAB to the component
<QuickActionFAB />
```

## Migration from Old System

### Old Components (Deprecated)
- `QuickActionModal.tsx` → Renamed to `QuickActionModal.old.tsx`
- Old modal-based approach replaced with FAB + responsive hub

### Backup Location
- Backup created at: `backups/quick-actions-backup-20250812-085338/`
- Contains original files before redesign
- Git stash also created for safety

## Restoration Instructions

If you need to revert to the old system:

```bash
# Option 1: Restore from backup
cp backups/quick-actions-backup-20250812-085338/* src/components/wins/

# Option 2: Restore from git stash
git stash pop

# Remove new components

rm src/components/wins/QuickActionForm.tsx
rm src/components/wins/QuickActionFAB.tsx

```

## Benefits of New System
