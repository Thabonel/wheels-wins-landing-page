# Performance Optimization Recommendations

These guidelines outline best practices for keeping the Wheels & Wins application fast and efficient.

## Frontend
- Enable code splitting in Vite to reduce initial bundle size.
- Serve static assets with long cache headers.
- Use lazy loading for heavy components and images.
- Monitor React component renders with the React DevTools profiler.

## Backend
- Use async database operations via SQLAlchemy asyncio to maximize throughput.
- Cache expensive API calls using Redis with sensible TTLs.
- Profile API endpoints and refactor any slow queries.
- Enable gzip compression in your reverse proxy (Nginx).

## Database
- Ensure indexes exist on frequently queried columns such as `user_id` and timestamp fields.
- Use connection pooling to minimize connection overhead.
- Regularly run `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` on large tables.

Following these recommendations will help the application scale while keeping response times low.
