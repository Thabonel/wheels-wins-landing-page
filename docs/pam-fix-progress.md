# PAM Fix Progress Report

## Date: September 2, 2025

### ✅ Completed Steps

#### Step 1: Backup Created
- Location: `backups/pam-backup-20250902-083037/`
- To restore: `cp -r backups/pam-backup-20250902-083037/* src/`

#### Step 2: Simplified Implementation
- Created `src/components/PamSimple.tsx` - A clean, text-only chat implementation
- Based on successful patterns from:
  - OpenAI Realtime API (persistent WebSocket, session management)
  - Vercel AI SDK (message queuing, error recovery)

#### Step 3: Integration
- Updated `src/components/Layout.tsx` to use PamSimple instead of complex Pam.tsx
- Using existing `usePamWebSocketUnified` hook for WebSocket management

#### Step 4: Fixed Dependencies
- Installed missing packages:
  - `@rollup/rollup-darwin-x64`
  - `@esbuild/darwin-x64`
- Dev server now running successfully on http://localhost:8080/

### 📋 Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Dev server running
- ✅ Simplified PAM component loads without errors
- ✅ WebSocket connection logic in place
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ Message send/receive UI
- ✅ Auto-reconnect logic (5 attempts with exponential backoff)

**What's Simplified:**
- Removed voice/TTS/location features (temporarily)
- Focused on core text chat functionality
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper error boundaries

### 🧪 Testing

**Test Page Created:**
- `public/test-pam-simple.html` - Standalone WebSocket connection tester
- Access at: http://localhost:8080/test-pam-simple.html

**Backend Status:**
- Primary: https://pam-backend.onrender.com (operational)
- Health endpoint: https://pam-backend.onrender.com/api/health

### 🔧 Architecture

```
PamSimple.tsx
    ↓
usePamWebSocketUnified (WebSocket management)
    ↓
Backend: pam-backend.onrender.com
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Connection Management**: Auto-connect on component mount
2. **Retry Logic**: 5 attempts with exponential backoff (3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, 30s)
3. **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for connection state
4. **Message Queue**: Handles incoming/outgoing messages
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of disconnections

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Basic Chat** (Current)
   - Verify WebSocket connection
   - Test message send/receive
   - Check auto-reconnect

2. **Add Reliability** (Pending)
   - Message persistence (sessionStorage)
   - Offline queue
   - Connection health monitoring

3. **Gradual Feature Addition** (Future)
   - Re-enable voice features
   - Add TTS support
   - Restore location features

### 📝 Notes

- Using minimal approach - no rebuild, just targeted fixes
- Keeping all complex features commented out for now
- Focus on getting basic chat working first
- Once stable, can gradually re-enable advanced features

### 🔗 Resources

- WebSocket URL format: `/api/v1/pam/ws/${userId}?token=${token}`
- Backend health: https://pam-backend.onrender.com/api/health
- Dev server: http://localhost:8080/

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- Recharts dependency errors (not affecting PAM)
- Some unused WebSocket implementations still in codebase (can clean later)

### ✨ Success Criteria

- [ ] Can open PAM chat window
- [ ] Can connect to WebSocket
- [ ] Can send a message
- [ ] Can receive a response
- [ ] Auto-reconnects on disconnect
- [ ] No console errors related to PAM

This simplified approach follows the principle of "small steps, realistic goals" - focusing on getting basic functionality working before adding complexity.
