## ❌ What's Currently Broken

**Database Connection Issues:**
The module is experiencing 403/406 errors when trying to fetch data because:
1. ✅ Frontend query patterns were incorrect (FIXED - commit 57a78c36)
2. ⏳ Database RLS policies need updating (SQL fix ready, needs manual application)

**Once SQL fixes are applied, everything should work as described above.**

---

## 🔧 For Developers: What Needs Fixing

**SQL fixes ready to apply:**
- File: `docs/sql-fixes/MASTER_FIX_ALL_RLS_ISSUES.sql`
- What it does:
  - Fixes transition_profiles RLS policies (uses `id = auth.uid()`)
  - Fixes calendar_events RLS policies
  - Creates likes table

**Apply in Supabase SQL Editor:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kycoklimpzkyrecbjecn/sql
2. Copy entire MASTER_FIX_ALL_RLS_ISSUES.sql file
3. Paste and run
4. Verify policies are created correctly

**Frontend fixes:**
- ✅ Already deployed to staging (commit 57a78c36)
- Fixed incorrect query patterns in 4 components

**Testing after fixes:**
1. Navigate to Life Transition module
2. Should see onboarding wizard
3. Complete wizard or skip
4. Dashboard should load with all sections
5. No console errors about transition_profiles
