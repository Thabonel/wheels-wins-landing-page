# 🚨 EMERGENCY SITE FIX - Staging Backend Issues

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Status**: CRITICAL - Site completely broken due to backend issues  
**REAL ISSUE**: NOT Purple PAM - Backend CORS & connectivity failures

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis From Console Logs**

The site is broken because of **backend service failures**, not Purple PAM:

### **Critical Errors Identified**:

1. **CORS Policy Failures**:
   ```
   Access to fetch at 'https://wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com' 
   has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't 
   pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.
   ```

2. **WebSocket Connection Failures**:
   ```
   WebSocket connection to 'wss://wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com/api/v1/pam/ws' failed
   PAM WebSocket disconnected: 1006
   ```

3. **Authentication Failures**:
   ```
   GET .../api/v1/pam/agentic/capabilities 401 (Unauthorized)
   ```

4. **Database Permission Errors**:
   ```
   Error fetching income data: permission denied for table income_entries
   ```

5. **Method Not Allowed Errors**:
   ```
   GET .../api/v1/pam/savings/recent 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   GET .../api/v1/pam/savings/guarantee-status 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   ```

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED**

### **Fix #1: Check Render Backend Service Status**

The staging backend `wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com` appears to be:
- ❌ Down or not responding properly
- ❌ CORS not configured for staging domain
- ❌ Missing API endpoints
- ❌ Authentication issues

**Action**: Check Render dashboard for `wheels-wins-backend-staging` service

### **Fix #2: Verify Environment Variables**

Check that staging frontend has correct backend URL:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com
VITE_WS_OVERRIDE=wss://wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com/api/v1/pam/ws
```

### **Fix #3: Database RLS Policies**

Database queries failing with permission errors:
```sql
-- Check if these tables have proper RLS policies:
- income_entries
- user_settings
```

### **Fix #4: Backend API Endpoints**

Missing or misconfigured endpoints:
- `/api/v1/pam/savings/recent` (405 error)
- `/api/v1/pam/savings/guarantee-status` (405 error)
- `/api/v1/pam/agentic/capabilities` (401 error)

## 🔧 **Emergency Backend Checklist**

### **Render Service Check**:
1. ✅ Login to Render.com dashboard
2. ✅ Check `wheels-wins-backend-staging` service status
3. ✅ Verify service is deployed and running
4. ✅ Check service logs for errors
5. ✅ Verify environment variables are set

### **CORS Configuration**:
1. ✅ Backend must allow `https://wheels-wins-staging.netlify.app`
2. ✅ Check CORS origins in backend config
3. ✅ Verify preflight requests are handled

### **Database Issues**:
1. ✅ Check Supabase project is accessible
2. ✅ Verify RLS policies for `income_entries` table
3. ✅ Test database connection from backend

## 🚫 **Purple PAM Is NOT The Issue**

From the console logs, Purple PAM is NOT appearing or causing issues:
- ✅ No Purple PAM error messages
- ✅ No AI SDK fallback triggers
- ✅ Modern PAM is trying to connect (correctly)
- ❌ But it can't connect due to backend issues

The error boundary is catching crashes caused by backend connectivity failures, not Purple PAM conflicts.

---

## 🔧 **Temporary Frontend Fix**

While backend is being fixed, we can add error boundaries to prevent complete crashes:

```typescript
// Add fallback when backend is down
if (connectionStatus === "Disconnected") {
  return <div>PAM is currently offline. Backend services are being restored.</div>
}
```

---

## 🎯 **Next Actions**

1. **URGENT**: Check Render backend service status
2. **URGENT**: Verify backend deployment and logs  
3. **URGENT**: Fix CORS configuration for staging domain
4. **URGENT**: Verify database RLS policies
5. **Medium**: Add better error handling for backend failures

**🚨 PRIORITY: Fix backend connectivity first - Purple PAM removal can wait!**
