# Current Backend State Snapshot
**Timestamp**: August 20, 2025 - 02:30 UTC  
**Purpose**: Pre-deployment backup for safe rollback

## 🔄 Staging Backend (WORKING)
**Service**: `wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com`

### Status: ✅ HEALTHY
- **Startup**: Clean initialization
- **PAM Service**: Fully operational
- **JWT Authentication**: Working (with signature verification warning)
- **CORS**: Properly configured for staging domain
- **WebSocket**: Available and functional
- **Health Endpoint**: Responding correctly

### Last Known Good Logs:
```
✅ Application startup complete
✅ All performance optimizations active  
✅ Enhanced security system active
🔐 User authenticated: 21a2151a-cd37-41d5-a1c7-124bb05e7a6a
⚠️ JWT decode failed: Signature verification failed (but working)
```

### Environment Variables Count: 61 variables
**Critical Variables Present**:
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_KEY` 
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ✅ `CORS_ORIGINS` (properly formatted)
- ✅ `APP_URL=https://pam-backend.onrender.com`
- ✅ `DEBUG=true`
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=staging`
- ✅ `ENVIRONMENT=staging`
- ✅ `VITE_USE_AI_SDK_PAM=true`

## 🚨 Production Backend (BROKEN)
**Service**: `pam-backend.onrender.com`

### Status: ❌ EMERGENCY MODE
- **Startup**: Event loop initialization error
- **PAM Service**: Failed to initialize
- **Error**: `Failed to initialize AI service: no running event loop`
- **Mode**: Emergency fallback with basic functionality only
- **CORS**: Malformed configuration

### Current Error Logs:
```
❌ PAMServiceError: Failed to initialize AI service: no running event loop
❌ RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'AIService.initialize' was never awaited
⚠️ PAM running in emergency mode with basic functionality
```

### Environment Variables: 56 variables (5 missing)
**Missing Critical Variables**:
- ❌ `APP_URL` (missing)
- ❌ `DEBUG` (missing)  
- ❌ `NODE_ENV` (missing)
- ❌ `ENVIRONMENT` (missing)
- ❌ `VITE_USE_AI_SDK_PAM` (missing)

## 📋 Frontend Configuration

### Staging Frontend
- **URL**: `https://wheels-wins-staging.netlify.app`
- **Backend Target**: `wheels-wins-backend-staging.onrender.com`
- **Status**: Successfully connecting to staging backend
- **PAM Status**: JWT authentication issue (but backend working)

### Production Frontend  
- **URL**: `https://wheelsandwins.com`
- **Backend Target**: `pam-backend.onrender.com` 
- **Status**: Cannot connect due to backend emergency mode
- **PAM Status**: Network errors due to broken backend

## 🎯 Deployment Plan Summary

### What We're Fixing:
1. **Sync code** from working staging to broken production
2. **Add 5 missing environment variables** to production
3. **Test identical behavior** between both backends

### Expected Outcome:
- Both backends start cleanly
- Both backends have identical logs
- PAM works on both staging and production
- Proper staging → production deployment pipeline

## 🛡️ Rollback Information

### Last Known Working State (Production):
- **Service**: `pam-backend.onrender.com`
- **Status**: Emergency mode (current state before changes)
- **Deployment**: Previous deployment in Render history
- **Environment**: 56 variables (current configuration)

### Rollback Steps If Needed:
1. **Render Dashboard** → pam-backend → Deploys tab
2. **Find previous deployment** from deployment history
3. **Click "Redeploy"** on last working version
4. **Restore environment variables** to current snapshot
5. **Verify emergency mode functionality** restored

### Safety Net:
- **Staging backend remains untouched** throughout process
- **Frontend can always fall back** to staging backend
- **All changes are reversible** through Render dashboard
- **Environment variables are backed up** in this document

## 🔍 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Before Making Changes:
- [x] ✅ Document current working staging state
- [x] ✅ Document current broken production state  
- [x] ✅ Identify exact differences (5 env vars)
- [x] ✅ Create comprehensive backup strategy
- [x] ✅ Establish rollback procedures
- [ ] 🔄 Verify staging backend git commit/branch
- [ ] 🔄 Execute deployment with monitoring
- [ ] 🔄 Test and validate new production state
