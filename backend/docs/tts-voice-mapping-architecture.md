# TTS Voice Mapping Architecture Fix

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive solution implemented to fix the Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice ID mapping issues in the Wheels & Wins application. The solution addresses the core problem where Edge TTS was receiving Coqui voice IDs (like 'p225') instead of proper Edge TTS voice IDs (like 'en-US-JennyNeural').

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The system had multiple TTS engines (Edge TTS, Coqui TTS, System TTS, Supabase TTS) but lacked a unified voice mapping system. Different parts of the application were using engine-specific voice IDs directly, causing mismatches when voice IDs from one engine were passed to another.

### Specific Issues
1. **Voice ID Mismatch**: Edge TTS receiving 'p225' (Coqui) instead of 'en-US-JennyNeural' (Edge)
2. **Configuration Inconsistency**: `TTS_VOICE_DEFAULT` set to legacy voice IDs
3. **No Fallback Logic**: Engines failing without proper error handling
4. **Legacy Support**: No backward compatibility for existing voice configurations

## Architecture Solution

### 1. Voice Mapping System (`voice_mapping.py`)

#### Core Components
- **`VoiceMappingService`**: Central service for voice ID translation
- **`VoiceMapping`**: Dataclass defining generic voice with engine-specific mappings
- **`VoiceCharacteristic`**: Enum for voice characteristics (gender, age, accent, style)

#### Key Features
- **Generic Voice IDs**: Platform-agnostic voice identifiers (e.g., `pam_female_professional`)
- **Engine Mapping**: Automatic translation to engine-specific IDs
- **Legacy Support**: Backward compatibility with existing voice IDs
- **Context Awareness**: Intelligent voice selection based on content
- **Quality Scoring**: Voice ranking system for optimal selection

#### Voice Mapping Examples
```python
"pam_female_professional" -> {
    "edge": "en-US-JennyNeural",
    "coqui": "p267", 
    "system": "default_female",
    "supabase": "nari-dia"
}

"pam_male_calm" -> {
    "edge": "en-US-GuyNeural",
    "coqui": "p232",
    "system": "default_male", 
    "supabase": "nari-dia"
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling (`error_handling.py`)

#### Error Classification System
- **`TTSErrorClassifier`**: Categorizes errors by type and severity
- **`TTSErrorRecovery`**: Manages error history and circuit breakers
- **`TTSFallbackManager`**: Executes recovery strategies

#### Error Types and Recovery
```python
NETWORK_ERROR -> ["retry_with_delay", "switch_engine", "return_text_fallback"]
VOICE_NOT_FOUND -> ["use_fallback_voice", "voice_mapping_fallback", "switch_engine"]
QUOTA_EXCEEDED -> ["switch_engine", "use_system_tts", "queue_for_later"]
```

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic engine disabling after repeated failures
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Health score tracking for engine recovery

### 3. Enhanced TTS Service Integration

#### Voice Resolution Pipeline
1. **Input Analysis**: Detect legacy vs generic voice IDs
2. **Context Detection**: Analyze text for appropriate voice selection
3. **Voice Mapping**: Translate to engine-specific voice IDs
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback and recovery

#### Intelligent Fallback Chain
```
Edge TTS -> Coqui TTS -> System TTS -> Supabase TTS -> Text Fallback
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Updates

#### User Config (`user_config.py`)
```python
# Before
TTS_VOICE_DEFAULT: str = "en-US-JennyNeural"  # Engine-specific

# After  
TTS_VOICE_DEFAULT: str = "pam_female_professional"  # Generic voice ID
```

#### Environment Variables (`.env.example`)
```bash
# Before
TTS_VOICE_DEFAULT=en-US-SaraNeural

# After
TTS_VOICE_DEFAULT=pam_female_professional

# Voice Mapping Examples:
# pam_female_professional - Professional mature female voice
# pam_female_friendly - Warm, friendly female voice  
# pam_male_professional - Authoritative professional male voice
# pam_travel_guide - Energetic voice for travel content
# pam_default - Default PAM voice with intelligent fallbacks
```

### 2. API Enhancements

#### New Debugging Endpoints
- **`/api/v1/pam/tts-debug`**: Comprehensive TTS system status
- **`/api/v1/pam/voice-mapping-test`**: Voice mapping validation
- **`/api/v1/pam/voice-test`**: Voice synthesis testing

#### Enhanced Voice Generation
```python
# Before - Direct engine-specific voice ID
result = await enhanced_tts_service.synthesize(
    text=request.text,
    voice_id="en-US-JennyNeural"  # Hardcoded Edge TTS voice
)

# After - Generic voice ID with mapping
result = await enhanced_tts_service.synthesize(
    text=request.text,
    voice_id="pam_female_professional"  # Resolves to appropriate engine voice
)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Testing

## Voice ID Migration Guide

### Legacy to Generic Mapping
| Legacy Voice ID | Generic Voice ID | Description |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| `p225` | `pam_female_friendly` | Friendly female voice |
| `p228` | `pam_male_professional` | Professional male voice |
| `en-US-JennyNeural` | `pam_female_professional` | Professional female voice |
| `en-US-AriaNeural` | `pam_female_friendly` | Friendly female voice |
| `en-US-GuyNeural` | `pam_male_calm` | Calm male voice |

### Recommended Generic Voice IDs
- **`pam_default`**: Default PAM voice with best fallbacks
- **`pam_female_professional`**: Business/formal contexts
- **`pam_female_friendly`**: Casual conversations
- **`pam_male_calm`**: Emergency/assistance contexts
- **`pam_travel_guide`**: Travel planning content
- **`pam_financial_advisor`**: Financial guidance

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Reduced Errors**: Proper voice mapping eliminates engine mismatches
- **Faster Recovery**: Circuit breakers prevent repeated failed attempts
- **Better Caching**: Generic IDs enable better cache hit rates
- **Smart Selection**: Context-aware voices improve user experience

### Overhead Considerations
- **Memory**: Voice mapping database (~50KB)
- **CPU**: Voice resolution adds ~1ms per request
- **Network**: Error recovery may increase fallback attempts
