# PAM WebSocket Authentication Fix - August 2, 2025

## Overview
This document chronicles the investigation and resolution of critical PAM (Personal AI Manager) authentication issues that were causing connection loops, voice playback failures, and poor user experience.

## Initial Problem Report

### Symptoms
1. **Authentication Loop**: PAM connecting and disconnecting repeatedly
2. **Voice Errors**: Blob URLs returning 404 errors
3. **Repeated Announcements**: PAM saying "Hi! I'm PAM..." multiple times
4. **Console Spam**: Continuous authentication failures in browser console

### Root Causes Identified
1. **WebSocket using User ID instead of JWT**: Frontend sending UUID (`21a2151a-cd37-41d5-a1c7-124bb05e7a6a`) instead of proper JWT token
2. **Voice Cache Issues**: Cached blob URLs becoming invalid after page reload
3. **Missing Reconnection Logic**: No limit on authentication retry attempts

### Backend Error Logs
```
{"event": "‚ùå WebSocket authentication failed: 401: Invalid JWT format: Not enough segments", "logger": "app.api.v1.pam", "level": "warning"}
{"event": "üîê JWT decode failed: Not enough segments", "logger": "api.deps", "level": "error"}
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend WebSocket Authentication (Committed but not yet deployed)

#### Created Authentication Utilities (`src/utils/websocketAuth.ts`)
- JWT token validation with format and expiration checking
- Automatic token refresh when nearing expiration
- WebSocketAuthManager class for lifecycle management
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Created Error Handler (`src/utils/authErrorHandler.ts`)
- Maps WebSocket close codes to specific auth errors
- Automatic recovery strategies (refresh, login, retry)
- User-friendly error messages with visual indicators
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent infinite retries

#### Updated Pam Component (`src/components/Pam.tsx`)
- Integrated WebSocketAuthManager for token management
- Uses JWT access tokens instead of user IDs
- Proper error handling with authentication recovery
- Added `hasShownWelcomeRef` to prevent repeated messages
- Limited reconnection attempts for authentication failures

### 2. Voice Playback Fix

#### Disabled Voice Caching (`src/lib/voiceService.ts`)
```typescript
// Skip cache for now due to blob URL expiration issues
// TODO: Implement persistent caching with IndexedDB or service worker
```
- Blob URLs were being cached but became invalid on page reload
- Temporarily disabled caching to always generate fresh audio
- Added TODO for proper persistent caching implementation

### 3. Backend Compatibility Layer (Deployed)

#### Modified WebSocket Authentication (`backend/app/api/v1/pam.py`)
```python
# TEMPORARY: Support both JWT tokens and user IDs during transition
uuid_pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}$')

if uuid_pattern.match(token):
    # Accept user ID during frontend deployment transition
    logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Using legacy user ID authentication for WebSocket (user_id: {token})")
    user_id = token
else:
    # Process as JWT token
```

#### Updated JWT Verification (`backend/app/api/deps.py`)
- Added UUID pattern matching in `verify_supabase_jwt_token_sync`
- Returns mock user data for UUID tokens
- Logs warnings when using legacy authentication

## Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Frontend Code Changes**: All authentication fixes implemented and pushed to GitHub
2. **Backend Compatibility**: Deployed to Render with UUID support
3. **Voice Cache Fix**: Disabled problematic caching
4. **Connection Loop Prevention**: Added retry limits and welcome message tracking

### ‚è≥ Pending
1. **Frontend Deployment**: Netlify needs to deploy the updated frontend code
2. **JWT Migration**: Frontend will start sending JWT tokens after deployment
3. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary UUID support once frontend is deployed

## Results After Backend Deployment

### ‚úÖ Success Logs
```
{"event": "‚ö†Ô∏è Using legacy user ID authentication for WebSocket (user_id: 21a2151a-cd37-41d5-a1c7-124bb05e7a6a)"}
{"event": "üîê WebSocket authenticated for user: 21a2151a-cd37-41d5-a1c7-124bb05e7a6a"}
{"event": "üîó WebSocket connected: 3add778c-c3b3-461e-b01a-b698cacc2eec"}
{"event": "‚úÖ Enhanced TTS successful with edge: 23328 bytes"}
```

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ No more authentication loops
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connections stay stable
- ‚úÖ Voice generation working correctly
- ‚úÖ No repeated welcome messages

## Code Changes Summary

### Frontend Files Modified
1. `src/components/Pam.tsx` - WebSocket authentication integration
2. `src/utils/websocketAuth.ts` - JWT authentication utilities (new)
3. `src/utils/authErrorHandler.ts` - Error handling utilities (new)
4. `src/lib/voiceService.ts` - Disabled voice caching

### Backend Files Modified
1. `backend/app/api/v1/pam.py` - Added UUID support for WebSocket
2. `backend/app/api/deps.py` - Added UUID support for JWT verification

### Git Commits
1. **Frontend JWT Implementation**
   ```
   fix: implement comprehensive WebSocket JWT authentication for PAM
   - Created WebSocket authentication utilities with JWT validation and refresh
   - Built AuthErrorHandler with automatic recovery and retry logic
   - Fixed Pam component to use proper JWT tokens instead of user IDs
   ```

2. **Connection Loop Prevention**
   ```
   fix: resolve PAM connection loop and voice playback issues
   - Prevent infinite authentication retry loops by stopping after 2 attempts
   - Add hasShownWelcomeRef to prevent repeated welcome messages
   - Disable voice caching temporarily to fix blob URL 404 errors
   ```

3. **Backend Compatibility**
   ```
   fix: add temporary UUID support for WebSocket authentication
   - Allow both JWT tokens and user IDs during frontend deployment transition
   - Add UUID pattern matching to accept legacy user ID authentication
   - Log warnings when using legacy authentication method
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Frontend Deployment**
   - Check Netlify deployment status
   - Verify JWT tokens are being sent after deployment

2. **Verify JWT Authentication**
   - Look for successful JWT authentication in logs
   - Confirm no more UUID warnings

3. **Remove Temporary Code**
   - Once frontend is fully migrated, remove UUID compatibility
   - Clean up temporary authentication code
   - Implement proper voice caching with IndexedDB

## Lessons Learned

1. **Deployment Coordination**: Frontend and backend changes should be coordinated to avoid authentication mismatches
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Temporary compatibility layers help during transitions
3. **Cache Management**: Blob URLs are ephemeral and shouldn't be cached long-term
4. **Error Recovery**: Proper retry limits and error handling prevent infinite loops
5. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and limited retries improve UX during failures

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Authentication Flow
1. Frontend requests JWT token from Supabase
2. Creates WebSocket URL with token parameter
3. Backend validates token (currently accepts UUIDs temporarily)
4. Establishes persistent WebSocket connection
5. Automatic token refresh before expiration

### Voice Generation Flow
1. Text sent to backend TTS endpoint
2. Edge TTS generates audio (primary)
3. Fallback to Supabase TTS if needed
4. Audio returned as byte array
5. Frontend creates blob URL (no longer cached)

### Error Recovery Strategy
1. Map WebSocket close codes to error types
2. Determine appropriate recovery action
3. Limit retry attempts with exponential backoff
4. Show user-friendly error messages
5. Graceful degradation to REST API if needed
