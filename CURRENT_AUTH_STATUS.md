# Current Authentication Status - URGENT

## ‚ùå Authentication is BROKEN in Production

### The Problem
- **Frontend (Production)**: Sending UUID tokens (`21a2151a-cd37-41d5-a1c7-124bb05e7a6a`)
- **Backend (Production)**: Only accepts JWT tokens, rejects UUIDs
- **Result**: Complete authentication failure - PAM is non-functional

### Why This Happened
1. Backend was updated to remove UUID compatibility (security fix)
2. Frontend hasn't been deployed with JWT fixes yet
3. There is NO transition period - authentication is completely broken

### Backend Logs Show
```
‚ùå WebSocket authentication failed: 401: Invalid JWT format: Not enough segments
üîê JWT decode failed: Not enough segments
```

### Immediate Actions Required

#### Option 1: Deploy Frontend NOW
The frontend code is ready and pushed. Need to ensure Netlify deploys it:
1. Check Netlify dashboard for build status
2. If stuck, trigger manual deployment
3. Clear cache if needed

#### Option 2: Temporarily Restore Backend Compatibility
If frontend deployment is delayed, we could restore UUID support to backend temporarily.

### Verification
Once frontend deploys:
1. Check `/auth-check.html` exists (confirms new deployment)
2. Monitor backend logs for JWT tokens instead of UUIDs
3. Run `window.authTestSuite.runFullTestSuite()` in browser

## Timeline
- **Now**: PAM completely broken ‚ùå
- **After frontend deploy**: PAM working with JWT auth ‚úÖ

## No Transition - Just Broken
There's no graceful transition. The app is broken until the frontend deploys with JWT support.
