IMPORTANT: Open Graph Image Missing
===================================

The website references "opengraph-image.png" but this file doesn't exist.

Required specifications:
- Filename: opengraph-image.png
- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (Facebook/Twitter optimal)
- Location: /public/opengraph-image.png
- Content suggestions:
  * Wheels & Wins logo
  * Tagline: "#1 RV Trip Planning & Budget App"
  * Visual of RV on scenic road
  * PAM AI assistant icon
  * Key features icons (trip planning, budget tracking, community)

This is CRITICAL for social media sharing visibility!

Alternative quick fix:
Use the existing hero image by updating meta tags to:
<meta property="og:image" content="https://wheelsandwins.com/WheelsnadwinsHero.jpg" />
