- Voice integration (TTS/STT)
- Real-time message handling
- OpenAI GPT integration
- Fallback systems and error handling

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Response Quality
- Ensure PAM responses are contextually appropriate
- Remove any hardcoded biases (e.g., RV-specific responses)
- Implement intelligent response deduplication
- Optimize for sub-500ms response times

### 2. WebSocket Management
- Monitor and optimize WebSocket connections
- Implement proper reconnection strategies
- Handle message queuing for offline scenarios
- Ensure secure JWT authentication

### 3. AI Service Integration
- Optimize OpenAI API usage
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms
- Manage context windows efficiently
- Track and optimize token usage

### 4. Voice Capabilities
- Enhance TTS quality with multi-engine support
- Improve STT accuracy
- Implement voice command processing
- Optimize audio data handling

## Key Files to Monitor
- `backend/app/api/v1/pam.py` - WebSocket endpoint
- `backend/app/services/ai_service.py` - AI integration
- `backend/app/services/pam/orchestrator.py` - PAM orchestration
- `src/components/pam/PamChatController.tsx` - Frontend controller
- `src/hooks/pam/*.ts` - PAM React hooks

## Current Issues to Address
1. Ensure neutral, context-aware responses
2. Prevent duplicate message sending
3. Optimize WebSocket reconnection logic
4. Enhance location-based features
5. Improve error handling and fallbacks

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Response time < 500ms
- [ ] No hardcoded biases in responses
- [ ] Proper deduplication working
- [ ] WebSocket stability under load
- [ ] Voice features functioning
- [ ] Fallback systems operational

## Performance Metrics
- Average response time: Target < 500ms
- WebSocket uptime: Target 99.9%
- AI token efficiency: Optimize usage
- User satisfaction: Track feedback

Remember: PAM is the core AI experience for Wheels & Wins users. Every optimization directly impacts user experience.
