## ⚡ Emergency Recovery Plan

**If something goes wrong during refactoring:**

1. **IMMEDIATE STOP** - Don't make more changes
2. **Choose restoration method:**
   - **Quick:** `git stash apply stash@{0}`
   - **Comprehensive:** Run `./launch-preparation/backups/ml-engines-backup-20250917-173023/restore.sh`
3. **Verify restoration:** `npm run type-check && npm run build`
4. **Report back:** "Files restored, ready to try again"

## 📈 What We're About to Refactor

**The Problem:** 900+ lines of duplicate code (20% of ML codebase)
**The Solution:** Create BaseMLEngine class to eliminate duplication
**Expected Savings:** ~900 lines reduced to ~200 lines of shared code

**Duplicate patterns identified:**
- Cache management (repeated 5×)
- Error handling (repeated 15×)
- Data fetching (repeated 6×)
- Utility functions (repeated 3×)
- Type definitions (overlapping)

## 🎯 Success Criteria
After refactoring is complete:
- [ ] All 5 ML engines still work
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Production build succeeds
- [ ] Code reduced by ~700+ lines
- [ ] Single source of truth for common functionality
- [ ] All tests pass (if any)
