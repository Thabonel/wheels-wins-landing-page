# üö® URGENT: Frontend Deployment Required

## Critical Issue
The backend logs show that the frontend is still sending UUID tokens instead of JWT tokens, causing authentication failures.

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Still receiving `token=21a2151a-cd37-41d5-a1c7-124bb05e7a6a` (UUID)
- **Expected**: Should receive JWT token like `token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- **Result**: Continuous authentication loops with "JWT decode failed: Not enough segments"

## Code Status
‚úÖ All authentication fixes have been committed to the repository:
- `3d37f9c` - fix: resolve build errors in auth imports
- `adbec4e` - fix: resolve PAM authentication loop and WebMediaPlayer overflow issues  
- `e1d2653` - perf: optimize PAM WebSocket performance
- `dccf9e7` - fix: comprehensive PAM voice assistant fixes

## Action Required

### Option 1: Check Netlify Deployment
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Check if the latest deployment includes commits `3d37f9c` or newer
3. If not, trigger a manual deployment

### Option 2: Force Redeploy
```bash
# Make a trivial change to force deployment
echo "// Force redeploy $(date)" >> src/main.tsx
git add src/main.tsx
git commit -m "chore: force frontend redeploy for JWT auth fixes"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Clear Build Cache
In Netlify Dashboard:
1. Go to Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Environment
2. Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Open browser DevTools
2. Check Network tab for WebSocket connection
3. Verify URL contains JWT token (long string with dots)
4. Run: `window.authTestSuite.runFullTestSuite()`

## Expected Backend Logs After Fix
```
‚úÖ WebSocket authenticated for user: [user-id]
‚úÖ Using JWT authentication
```

## Current Backend Logs (Problem)
```
‚ùå WebSocket authentication failed: 401: Invalid JWT format: Not enough segments
üîê JWT decode failed: Not enough segments
```

The frontend code is ready and working locally. We just need to ensure it's deployed to production.
