# PAM 2.0 Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for PAM 2.0, covering unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing.

## Testing Objectives
- Ensure all success criteria are met
- Validate system performance and reliability
- Confirm user experience quality
- Verify security and data protection
- Test scalability and load handling

## Testing Scope

### Functional Testing
- **Conversation Management**: Natural language understanding and response generation
- **Memory Systems**: Context preservation and learning capabilities
- **Tool Integration**: Multi-tool orchestration and coordination
- **Voice Interaction**: STT/TTS functionality and conversation flow
- **Travel Planning**: Multi-step planning and proactive suggestions
- **Platform Control**: Website navigation and form interaction

### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, resource usage
- **Scalability**: Concurrent user handling, load distribution
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Reliability**: Error handling, failover, recovery
- **Usability**: User experience, accessibility, ease of use

## Test Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Focus Areas**: Core logic, memory operations, tool functions
- **Framework**: To be determined based on technology stack
- **Automation**: Fully automated with CI/CD integration

### Integration Testing
- **API Testing**: REST endpoints and WebSocket protocols
- **Database Testing**: Data persistence and retrieval
- **External Integrations**: Third-party service connections
- **Cross-Component**: Agent-memory-tool interaction

### System Testing
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Complete user workflows
- **Conversation Flows**: Multi-turn conversation handling
- **Feature Integration**: Combined functionality testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Failure modes and recovery

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Normal traffic simulation
- **Stress Testing**: High traffic and resource limits
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden traffic increases
- **Volume Testing**: Large data set handling

### Security Testing
- **Authentication Testing**: Login and session management
- **Authorization Testing**: Access control validation
- **Data Protection**: PII handling and encryption
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Common security issues

### User Acceptance Testing
- **Usability Testing**: User experience validation
- **Feature Acceptance**: Success criteria verification
- **Accessibility Testing**: Compliance with standards
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Compatibility validation
