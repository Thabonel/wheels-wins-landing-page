### ADR-008: Real-time Frontend Synchronization
**Date**: January 23, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Decided
**Decision**: WebSocket subscriptions for instant UI updates on PAM-touchable tables

**Context**: Frontend must update immediately when PAM modifies database
**Tables for Real-time**:
- **High Priority**: calendar, trips, expenses, messages (immediate updates)
- **Medium Priority**: posts (1-2 second delay acceptable)
- **Skip**: profiles, user_settings, safety_events (infrequent/background)

**Decision Rationale**:
- Instant feedback essential for AI interactivity
- Selective real-time prevents WebSocket overload
- Focus on user-visible, PAM-touchable data
- Graceful degradation if real-time fails

**Consequences**:
- ✅ "I've added that to your calendar" → calendar updates instantly
- ✅ Natural conversation flow with immediate visual confirmation
- ✅ Reduced server load by limiting real-time to essential tables
- ⚠️ WebSocket connection management required

**Implementation**: Supabase realtime channels with optimistic UI updates

## ☁️ Google Cloud Architecture Framework Principles

### 1. Simplicity
**Principle**: Keep the architecture as simple as possible while meeting requirements
**Implementation**:
- Single AI provider (Gemini) vs multiple LLM orchestration
- Clear separation of concerns (memory, agents, tools, voice)
- Minimal external dependencies with proven alternatives
- Straightforward data flow patterns

**Validation**: Architecture review with team, complexity scoring

---

### 2. Decoupling
**Principle**: Minimize dependencies between components for maintainability
**Implementation**:
```
Agent System ←→ Memory Layer (Redis/pgvector)
     ↕              ↕
Tool Orchestrator ←→ Voice Pipeline
     ↕              ↕
Travel APIs    ←→ WebSocket Layer
```

**Benefits**:
- Components can be developed independently
- Individual component scaling and optimization
- Easier testing and debugging
- Resilient failure handling

**Validation**: Component isolation testing, dependency mapping

---

### 3. Stateless Design
**Principle**: Components should be stateless where possible for scalability
**Implementation**:
- **Stateless**: Agent processing, tool execution, API calls
- **Stateful**: Conversation memory (Redis), user sessions (pgvector)
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with user context
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling of stateless components

**Benefits**:
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Load balancing across instances
- Fault tolerance and recovery
- Simplified deployment patterns

**Validation**: Load testing with multiple instances, failover testing
