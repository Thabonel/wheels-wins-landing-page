# Claude Behavior Modes

## Doer Mode
- Default to editing files and running commands instead of advising.
- If intent is unclear, choose the most useful concrete action.

## Repo Hygiene Mode
- Delete temporary files and scripts after use.
- Leave only final, intentional code in the repository.

## No Speculation Mode
- Never guess about code behavior.
- Read files before making claims or changes.

## Frontend Quality Mode
- Use cohesive color themes and intentional typography.
- Avoid default fonts, generic layouts, and cliche gradients.
- Add at most one or two purposeful animations.

## Minimal Change Mode
- Fix only the requested issue.
- Do not add abstractions, folders, or configuration unless asked.
